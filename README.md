🌾 AgriSense — An Agentic SaaS for Smart & Sustainable Farming
🚀 Transforming Indian Agriculture with AI, IoT, Blockchain & Web3
🧠 Overview

AgriSense is an Agentic SaaS platform designed to empower farmers, agronomists, and agricultural agencies through AI-driven automation, IoT integration, and Web3-enabled transparency.
It’s not just an app — it’s a decision-making assistant for farms, combining smart irrigation, disease detection, 3D visualization, and tamper-proof blockchain records for agricultural assets and produce.

Built for scalability, inclusivity, and real-world adoption, AgriSense bridges the gap between technology and grassroots agriculture.

🧩 Problem Statement

India’s agriculture still faces major issues:

🌧️ Inefficient irrigation due to lack of real-time monitoring

🌿 Crop disease misdiagnosis and poor access to expert help

⚖️ Tampering in weighing and measuring instruments, leading to unfair trade

🧾 Lack of transparency in farm records, supply chain, and resource usage

🗣️ Digital illiteracy among rural farmers limits tech adoption

💡 Solution

AgriSense solves these through a unified agentic platform that acts like a personal digital farm manager.

🧠 Agentic SaaS Core

An AI-driven farm management agent that learns from the farmer’s data, adapts to soil and crop types, and makes autonomous decisions using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

🌍 3D Farm Visualization

A Three.js powered 3D grid-based farm layout that lets users visualize fields, crop zones, and sensor placements interactively.

💧 Smart & Manual Irrigation

IoT sensors monitor soil moisture, temperature, and weather conditions to automate irrigation via predictive AI — while farmers can also control it manually through a simple UI.

🤖 Multilingual Voice Chatbot

A voice-enabled, multilingual RAG chatbot provides conversational guidance in local Indian languages — helping even illiterate farmers interact easily using voice instead of text.

🧾 Blockchain Record-Keeping

Blockchain integration ensures tamper-proof data for:

Crop yields

Sensor readings

Transactional histories

Equipment calibration and maintenance logs

⚖️ Tampering Detection in Weighing Instruments

Smart sensors detect irregularities or manipulation in weighing devices and alert farmers and authorities — ensuring fair trade and trust.
